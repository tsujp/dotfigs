# Dotfiles

All my dotfiles, blah blah.

Includes a bunch of scripts under `meta-config/` to manage system-dependent
tweaks. That menu system is done via `sontek` which you can find
[here](https://github.com/tsujp/sontek).

## Install

Run `make` at the root of this repo and follow bash prompts for additional config.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@git.sr.ht:~tsujp/dotfiles .
```
